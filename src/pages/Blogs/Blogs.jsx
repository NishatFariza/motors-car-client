                Purpose Of NodeJS:
              </strong>
              Node.js is an open source, a server-side script which runs on the
              top of Google’s open-source scripting engine V8. Node.js is fast,
              lightweight and efficient. It uses the asynchronous mode of
              operation, event-driven Input/Output rather than using the
              traditional threads or separate threads for each process.These are
              the libraries which are built by the awesome community which will
              solve almost all the generic problems related to the
              Node.js.Overall it increases the efficiency of the development
              process as it fills the gap between frontend and backend
              applications.

                Purpose Of MongoDB:
              </strong>
              MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. so we
              need to understand when and When we need to use this type of
              database in the real-life applications. Since in normal
              circumstances, MongoDB always preferred by the developers or
              project managers when our main concern is the deal with large
              volume of data with a high performance. If we want to insert
              thousands of records in a second, then MongoDB is the best choice
              for that. Also, horizontal scaling (adding new columns) is not so
              easy process in any RDBMS systems. But in case of MongoDB, it is
              very much easy since it is a schema less database.

                SQL:
              </strong>
              SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases
              (RDBMS). SQL databases defines and manipulates data based
              structured query language (SQL). In almost all situations SQL
              databases are vertically scalable. This means that you can
              increase the load on a single server by increasing things like
              RAM, CPU or SSD. SQL databases are table-based. SQL databases
              follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and
              Durability). Great support is available for all SQL database from
              their vendors. Also a lot of independent consultations are there
              who can help you with SQL database for a very large scale
              deployments.

                NoSQL:
              </strong>
              NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or
              distributed database. A NoSQL database has dynamic schema for
              unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways which means it can
              be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based or organized as
              a KeyValue store. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. NoSQL
              databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph
              databases or wide-column stores. The NoSQL database follows the
              Brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability and Partition
              tolerance). NoSQL database you still have to rely on community
              support and only limited outside experts are available for setting
              up and deploying your large scale NoSQL deployments.
