                JavaScript:
              </strong>
              Javascript is a programming language that is used for writing
              scripts on the website. It is basically used on the client-side.
              It is capable enough to add HTML and play with the DOM. Javascript
              can run in any browser engine as like JS core in safari and
              Spidermonkey in Firefox. It is the upgraded version of ECMA scrip
              that uses Chromeâ€™s V8 engine written in C++. Some of the
              javascript frameworks are RamdaJS, TypedJS, etc.

              the server-side. Nodejs does not have capability to add HTML tags.
              V8 is the Javascript engine inside of node.js that parses and runs
              Javascript. Nodejs is written in C, C++ and Javascript. Some of
              the Nodejs modules are Lodash, express etc. These modules are to
              be imported from npm.

                Reasons for using NodeJS:
              </strong>
              Nodejs is a Javascript engine that you can write any application
              you want with (by programming in the Javascript language). It runs
              your Javascript code. Most commonly, it is used to build servers
              that can respond to web requests, though it can be used for lots
              of other types of code too.Any project needs a programming
              environment and a runtime library that offers you basic
              programming tools/support and can compile and/or interpret your
              code. Nodejs is such as tool for the Javascript programming
              language. There are other similar tools for other languages such
              as Python, Java, PHP, C#, C++, Go, etc...
              <p className="mt-3">
                So, if you want to write some kind of stand-alone program or
                server in Javascript, then you can use nodejs for it.

              MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. MongoDB is a database that came into light around the mid-2000s. It comes under the category of a NoSQL database.

                SQL:
              </strong>
              SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases
              (RDBMS). SQL databases defines and manipulates data based
              structured query language (SQL). In almost all situations SQL
              databases are vertically scalable. This means that you can
              increase the load on a single server by increasing things like
              RAM, CPU or SSD. SQL databases are table-based. SQL databases
              follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and
              Durability). Great support is available for all SQL database from
              their vendors. Also a lot of independent consultations are there
              who can help you with SQL database for a very large scale
              deployments.

                NoSQL:
              </strong>
              NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or
              distributed database. A NoSQL database has dynamic schema for
              unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways which means it can
              be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based or organized as
              a KeyValue store. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. NoSQL
              databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph
              databases or wide-column stores. The NoSQL database follows the
              Brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability and Partition
              tolerance). NoSQL database you still have to rely on community
              support and only limited outside experts are available for setting
              up and deploying your large scale NoSQL deployments.

                JWT:
              </strong>
              JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a
              compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting
              information between parties as a JSON object. This information can
              be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can
              be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a
              public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA. When tokens are signed
              using public/private key pairs, the signature also certifies that
              only the party holding the private key is the one that signed it.

                Jwt Work:
              </strong>
              JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of
              claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two
              parties. A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by
              dots (.), and serialized using base64. In the most common
              serialization format, compact serialization, the JWT looks
              something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz. Once decoded, you will get
              two JSON strings: The header, The payload And The signature. The
              JOSE (JSON Object Signing and Encryption) header contains the type
              of token JWT in this case and the signing algorithm.
